# Online-Food-Donation-System
The “Online Food Donation System” is a web-based system created using PHP coding language which helps us to manage surplus food and reduce the wastage of the food. There are three main users in this system they are Donor, Organisations, and Admin. One feature of volunteers in this system is if anyone wants to join our team voluntarily.
